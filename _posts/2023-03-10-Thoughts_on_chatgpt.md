From december last year(2022), [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) has set off a new wave of AI boom.

Actually, ChatGPT is **interface** of a well pretrained and fine-tuned LLM(Large Language Model). In conventional paradigm, a model trained on datasets of target task can only solve the corresponding questions. While through intruction learning, ChatGPT has been tuned on various datasets which have be casted to dialogue form. Due to powerful abilities of understanding and generation, a large range of tasks can be easily solved by chatting. The research on limited NLP tasks will become meaningless soon.

"ChatGPT is just caculating probablities, and it doesn't have the ability of  **understanding** like human", Zhan Shi a professor of Shanghai Foreign Studies University(SISU) appraised ChatGPT. Before Understanding, the must be a entity who can understand. He quoted "I think, therefore I am (我思故我在)". The two "I" are different subjects, the "watched I" and the "watching I". The model can't imitate the "watching I". He also quoted Plato's learng theroy. The known we don't need to learn, and the totally unknown we can't learn, We are learning "We know what we don't know"(我们在学习“我们知道我们不知道的东西). We know what we don't know" is a kind of inborn ability while ChatGPT doesn't have

In my opinion, ChatGPT is a "iphone-level" innovation, will change the human-computer interaction(HCI) mode. Also the problem of information explosion can be alleviated. And with the development of LLM, everyone will have his own individual assisant just like a mobile phone. Futhermore, as the acquistion of information become more efficient, it will have a profound impact on society. For example , the teaching profession will be affected. The podcaster[2] says University teachers will also undergo a major differentiation screening and elimination.


##### Possible Opportunities
OpenAI has provided API of gpt3.5 which is quite easy-to-use. Obviously, ChatGPT will bring a large amount of bussiness opportunities. For example chatgt combined with wishper, language teachers maybe disappear.
- LLM
LLM itself is a big opportunity. Not every person or organization is allowed to use ChatGPT. The technical thresholad of traning and tuning LLM is quite high. Some pioneers have involved in this fields.

- Prompt engineering
[Jasper](https://www.jasper.ai/) is the leading role of this track.

- LLM + external data
The [**new bing**](https://www.bing.com/new) is a standard product.

- Integrate LLM with existing system.


##### Future of ChatGPT
- Multi-modal
Microsoft has proposed its Multimodal LLM(MLLM) named as **KOSMOS-1**[3]

- More paramaters
- More and Better data

However, Real intelligence can't be achieved only by above methods. There is still many problems which have to be research on, eg. the interpretability of nerual network, autonomous leanring and so on.

No doubt, ChatGPT is an important step towards intelligence for mankind.
